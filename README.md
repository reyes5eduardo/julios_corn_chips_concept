This was created as a proof of concept for Julio's Corn Chips and Salsas after expressing interest in updating their current website. 
I wanted to simplify their current website as there it feels crowded when navigating it. 
With this in mind I opted to design somethings simple but modern that places the emphasis on their products. 
The files showcase the main page that users would interact with when visiting the site and the products page with a simple grid. 

Figma files can be found on my site https://www.eduardoreyes/products.html
The current website can be seen at http://www.julioscornchips.com
